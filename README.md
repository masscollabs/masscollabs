A program is free software if the program’s users have the four essential freedoms:

* 0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
* 1. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
* 2. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
* 3. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
