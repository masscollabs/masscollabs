# On Software Security

For stable and secure software we need continuous test. For test we need a very-well disciplined community which has a clean code of conduct agreement and coding rules. We have decided to create five branches such as:

* devel-x
devel is development branch. It is not stable yet.
* master-x
devel is development branch. It is not stable yet.
* stable-x
stable is current stable branch.
* oldstable-x
oldstable is old version but supported.
* legacy-x
legacy is old version and not supported.
