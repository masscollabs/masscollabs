## Our New Organization Model

* We changed our mindset and the organization model from BSD-style to GNU-style. Thus we are a better **freedom respecting organization** and more **open** , and ready to collaborate with all people all around world.

## Why we are writing a Code of Conduct and why it is so important

* We are building a free, open and collaborative "free, open, friendly and collaborative community" in other words a community for communities and a company for companies.
* We need to tell ourselves in a clear way which lets outsiders understand what we are doing easily.
* We know what is Free Software and Open Source and "other" software ideas or paradigms. Let's get started with licenses.

## Core Values for Our Organizations' Work Processes

* Decentralized collaboration is the key strategy and value for our organizations. Thus developers contribute independently from all around the world.
* Transparency and accessibility are at the forefront. The information database and the software source code is open to everyone's control and the information is free as in freedom without no restrictions.
* Freedom and ethical values ​​are paramount and indispensable principles of our organizations. The software is distributed under free licenses such as the GNU General Public License (GPL).
* Community support is essential. Users and developers support the project with bug reports, documentation, and code contributions. Working independently of any institution and maintaining organizational independence and working freely are the main principles.

## Our Preferred Licenses

* We prefer Copyleft licenses. Mostly we prefer AGPLv3-or-later because we are focused on Internet technologies. But for other software GPLv3 or later, for documentation GFDLv1.3 or later, for artworks CC BY-SA 4.0 or later licenses are what we prefer for our own works. 

## Our Core Values

* freedom of speech
* openness
* collaborative working
* privacy of community members and customers
* and also [Four Freedoms written by Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)

## Happy hacking!

* Hacker is someone who is exploring limits of the related activity such as a Jazz improvisation with any instrument, or practicing martial arts in a clever way by following the martial arts culture, so the hacker culture itself and martial arts culture or Jazz culture are very similar thus we can say for all of them in short "hacker". They are all hackers. To be honest there are different approaches in hacker culture and this pluralism is what we need and like, and we encourage hackers to make their own practices and follow their own methodologies to do good and useful things for the **public**. 

* freedom is good
* openness is good
* collaboration is good
* privacy is good
* we demand to do good and useful things for the *public* and do **not** want to rely on any technology so we are authors and we can make something better replacing existing information and technology.
